So after three years of procrastinating, I finally started building my own portfolio website.

This was a good project to practice coding my design. I chose Jekyll because it was perfect for what I wanted: a blog and lightness. Their <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">documentation</a> is excellent and there's a lot of resources on the web. (A designer whom I admire wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@julesforrest/building-a-portfolio-with-jekyll-1883bce8e1a4#.e37bfp67a">a Medium article</a> about Jekyll, which also motivated me to learn!)

I used <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton.css </a> for the responsive framework, for the familiarity and simplicity of it.

I've also learned a bit about Markdown, Sass, and syntax-highlighting along the way.

Another goal of this project was to practice writing design case studies. Visuals simply do not tell the thought process and decisions that went into a design. They don't showcase that I can design with an intention. I hope to improve my writing skills by explaining my design processes.

I think this was a great way to start the new year! I'm a bit more motivated to fill this site with design and computer science adventures.
