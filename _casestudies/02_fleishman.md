  <span class="h3">Working with the Binghamton Brand</span>
  <p> For me, working with an established brand allows me to focus on the design problems associated with the content itself: organization and prioritization. </p>

  <p>Typically for every assignment, I am given the text content of the flyer, brochure, poster, etc. to be made. Other than the Cool/Hot Alumni Speaker Series (which already has a design template), I first play around with the layout of the content, and decide which information is the most important, can be taken out, and best fit together.<br> A few things I ask myself: "what items can be turned into a list for easy, concise reading?", "What photographs best represent the content?","Where/how can I break up the content into sections?"</p>

  <p>I typically like to use white on Binghamton's pantone green for headings, and the lighter green on pantone for subheadings.</p>

  <p>The following two brochures were the lengthier projects I got to work on. I designed a brochure about our alumni speaker series called Cool Hot Alumni, and designed another for our Employer Visits program.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, the Fleishman Center invites outside speakers to come to the university. For these designs, I do initial research to see if their company already have a brand design. I try my best to use their branding elements, such as font, color, and logos, in the promotional materials. This is my favorite example:</p>
