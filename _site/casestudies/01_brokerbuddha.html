  <p>My first assignment was to create the landing page in HTML/CSS. The layout was extremely simple, which was perfect for practicing how to code a responsive layout. I chose <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton.css </a> because of the simplicity and lightness of the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was also assigned to create a function that would save the email to a Google spreadsheet. To achieve this, I used a Javascript function and AJAX using the unique URL of Google Spreadsheets and AJAX 'POST' function. I faded the button and text field when the function was in progress as a user experience detail.

  <span class="h3">Product</span>
  <p>When I first arrived, the Broker Buddha product had basic functions and layout put in place. I had to ask <i>numerous</i> questions throughout the internship, as I was unfamiliar with the insurance world. I wanted to understand how the information and tools on the product can be organized so that a broker and client would have some intuition using the product.
  </p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/clientpage_old.png" />
  <p>My first task was to think of a better solution to organize 'Clients', 'Applications', 'Forms', 'People', and 'Renewals'. (I've learned that in the insurance world, a client is typically a company or organization). This was a long, iterative process, involving numerous discussions and drafts. In the end, we created this organization system: <br />
  - Clients had contacts associated with them (we replaced 'People' with 'Contacts' as it was more appropriate) <br />
  - Each contact had applications <br />
  - Applications contained individual insurance forms. Bundling forms into applications made the renewal process easier, as clients can simply renew an application versus renewing individual forms.
  </p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/clientpage_new.png" />

  <p>
    I also had the freedom to experiment with the visual design on the product. I changed the font from Flama to Open Sans. I felt that Open Sans was a cleaner sans-serif font and was easily accessible using Google Fonts API. <br />
    The client has the option to customize the colors of the product to match their own brand. I chose blue as the accent color in the UI designs as it felt most neutral. I got rid of the numerous accent colors in the old product to increase the contrast between accent color and neutral colors used for copy.
  </p>

  <p> Below was the old screen of adding new clients and forms.
  </p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/addclient_old.png" />
  <p>We changed the entire experience. Each step would take up the entire screen, and going to the next step was a simple slide transition (no refresh required). Clients now have the option to skip steps and come back to it later.</p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/addcontact_new.png" />
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/addclient_new.png" />

  <p>With the new organization system of forms and applications, we moved editing functions for individual classes of information to more accessible places.</p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/editcontact_old.png" />
  <p>To decrease visual clutter, we hid the Edit, Delete, and Renew buttons until a client selected an application.</p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/clientpage_new_select.png" />
  <p>Editing a client was as simple as clicking Edit Client on the new client page.</p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/editcontact_new.png" />

  <p>Insurance form-filling was the basis of the product. This was the form-filling experience of the old product:</p>
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../assets/brokerbuddha/editform_old.png" />
  <p>
  I brainstormed a few solutions to reorganize the content of form-filling. I moved the form sections to the left, as I felt that was more conventional and familiar, and redesigned a few UI elements. In insurance, it made more sense to organize forms by their coverage (especially in the client's perspective), with the form name secondary.</p>

  <span class="h3">Conclusions</span>
  <p>Designing was an extremely iterative process, which I do not illustrate here. There were many UI/UX problems that I didn't mention above. This was my first major user interface design experience and it was incredibly valuable to me. I've learn a <i>ton</i> and was extremely lucky that my boss took a huge risk to hire me as their design intern that summer. I loved the UI/UX problems we discussed and solved (and discovered more UI/UX issues in the process). This experience truly solidified my desire to work in product design in the future.</p>

  <p>I also fell in love with Manhattan this summer... amazing place!</p>
